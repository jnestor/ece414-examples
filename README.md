## ECE 414 Embedded Systems - Examples Repository
### Lafayette College - Easton Pennsylvania
This repository contains several examples which we will use
in class and lab.  You are welcome to download and use these
files as a starting point for your lab assignments, but
follow the course policy of crediting the source of code you are using.

Several of these examples are based on code in the
Raspberry Pi Pico examples repository and Hunter Adams'
ECE 4760 examples repository from Cornell University.
