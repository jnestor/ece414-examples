/*
 * Simple Timer Module
 * Read & calculate elapsed time with 32-bit timestamps
 * Note that the hardware_time module provides similar
 * functions using 64-bit timestamps
 * 
 * Caution: Rollover on 32-bit time measurementswill occur 
 * once every 2^32 microseconds (11.93 hours).  We handle one
 * rollover with the code provided, but if the time between
 * measurements exceeds twice this amount (23.8 hours) then
 * the calculation will be incorrect.  For measurements of
 * this duration, consider using the real-time clock instead
